            <p>Allow me to introduce myself. I am a sophomore student at <span>Delhi Technological University</span>, where I am pursuing a B.Tech in <span>Mathematics and Computing</span>. I am passionate about technology and science, and my journey in the field of programming has led me to gain expertise in <span>MERN stack development.</span> </p>

                <p>My educational foundation began at <span>Faith Academy School</span>, where I completed my schooling in 2021. It was during my time in college that I discovered the beauty of <span>Data Structures and Algorithms</span> (DSA) and how they play a crucial role in solving our day-to-day problems efficiently. Intrigued by this field, I delved deep into learning DSA concepts and honed my problem-solving skills through platforms like <span>LeetCode and CodeChef</span>.</p>
                <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I am driven by a strong desire to apply my knowledge for the betterment of society. I believe that technology can serve as a powerful tool in addressing societal challenges. By combining my passion for learning with my proficiency in MERN stack development, I strive to create innovative solutions that can positively impact people's lives.</p>
                
                <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a diligent work ethic and a thirst for knowledge. I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field. I actively participate in <span>workshops, hackathons, and coding competitions</span> to enhance my problem-solving abilities and foster a collaborative mindset.</p>
